# jquery-ctypefmt

This little beautifier will reformat and reindent bookmarklets, ugly
JavaScript, unpack scripts packed by Dean Edwardâ€™s popular packer,
as well as deobfuscate scripts processed by
[javascriptobfuscator.com](http://javascriptobfuscator.com/).

# Usage
You can beautify json,xml,html using jquery-ctypefmt in your web browser.


## JavaScript

As an alternative to the Python script, you may install the NPM package `js-beautify`. When installed globally, it provides an executable `js-beautify` script. As with the Python script, the beautified result is sent to `stdout` unless otherwise configured.

```html
<script src="//yourdomain/jquery.ctypefmt.js"></script>
```

```js
$.cTypeDetect = function(str);// detect your code type: "json,xml or html" will return
$.cTypeParse = function(str, ctype); // parse str and return "json,xml or html" Object, if ctype not set,the type will auto detect.
$.cTypeFmt = function(str, ctype); // format str and return "json,xml or html" style string, if ctype not set,the type will auto detect.
```
